# Changelog


## 3.1.7

- Fixed: a browser with an unfinished cross-device link (typed an email that already belongs to another device, never entered the 6-digit code) now opens straight onto the code screen. Previously the cached "day 1" dashboard was painted first and only replaced by the code screen after the code e-mail had been sent — close the drawer in that window and you had an e-mail with no memory of any code prompt.
- Fixed: that code is re-sent at most once every 10 minutes across drawer opens; "Send a new code" still always sends.

## 3.1.6

- Fixed: a long physical-prize name on the Day 2+ prize card shrinks to fit two lines (never below 55%) instead of growing the lockup — iOS/Android/Flutter parity.

## 3.1.5

- Fixed: the streak tile's confetti explosion at the reveal beat (and the burst over the total count-up) is now drawn on a canvas instead of an animated GIF. WebKit skips animated-image playback under iOS Reduce Motion and can defer decoding a freshly mounted GIF, which left iPhones with no explosion at all while the native SDKs always showed one. Same 2-second one-shot choreography; under reduced motion a static mid-burst scatter is held instead.

## 3.1.4

- Fixed: the publisher logo in the drawer header no longer flickers on open — one pre-decoded logo node is created when the branding config arrives and reused across every re-render instead of being rebuilt (and re-decoded) on each state change.

## 3.1.3

- Fixed: browsers with site data blocked no longer re-open the drawer on every navigation — an in-memory fallback holds the once-per-day mark and guest id within a page session.
- Fixed: the winner claim card keeps its correct height on browsers without `:has()` support (Chrome < 105, Safari < 15.4, Firefox < 121).

## 3.1.2

- Fixed: guest sessions no longer crash on browsers without `crypto.randomUUID` (Safari < 15.4) or on non-HTTPS pages — a fallback id generator engages.
- Fixed: calling `configure()` again with a signed-in user now performs the documented guest→user upgrade instead of silently doing nothing.
- Fixed: terminal backend rejections (giveaway ended mid-session, upgrade required) no longer show "Check your connection" with a dead-end retry — the drawer settles to the truthful state. Transport and 5xx failures keep the retry notice.
- Fixed: stray TypeErrors are no longer misclassified as offline events for the retry queue.

## 3.1.1 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Keyboard interaction across every input screen (mobile Safari especially): the drawer now listens to `window.visualViewport` and publishes the software keyboard's overlap as a CSS inset, so with the keyboard open every screen's scroll area gains matching bottom padding — VERIFY buttons, "Send a new code", legal footers and everything else below the focused field stay scroll-reachable instead of trapped behind the keyboard. On focus (and again once the keyboard settles, and as focus moves between fields) the focused field is scrolled visible above the keyboard inside the drawer's own scroll container; an open address-autocomplete suggestions list is included in the visibility target so it never hides under the keyboard. The inset zeroes on keyboard dismissal and all listeners detach with the experience — no stale insets or blank gaps.
- The 6-digit code screen (adoption OTP / email verification) had no scroll container at all: on short viewports — and always with the keyboard open — VERIFY, "Send a new code" and the legal footer could be unreachable. It now scrolls like every other screen, with the legal footer bottom-anchored inside the scrolling stack.
- Copy: "part of a Avafli streak" → "part of an Avafli streak" on the adoption code screen.

## 3.1.0 — 2026-09-01

### Added
- Offline resilience: same-day automatic retry of registration/claims on connectivity regain; offline analytics event buffering. A NETWORK-class (transport) failure of `registerDevice` or `claimDailyEntries` — the request never completed; a real HTTP response, 4xx or 5xx, never queues — persists a pending intent (`winr_offline_pending_intents_<bundleId>` in localStorage) and retries it automatically on the window `online` event, tab foreground, and a capped exponential backoff (hard max 5 attempts per page session). A transport-failed `configure()` keeps its configuration and the registration retry re-runs it. The intent is dropped when its local calendar day ends — cross-midnight replay is deliberately out of scope (server-authoritative day windows). Duplicate retries are safe: the backend dedups daily claims and an "already claimed" answer is treated as success. Publisher analytics events emitted while offline are buffered (bounded ring of 100, persisted under `winr_offline_analytics_buffer_<bundleId>`) and flushed on reconnect / next load carrying their original timestamps (`original_timestamp` / `original_timestamp_ms`). `AvafliError` now carries a typed optional `httpStatus`. No new UI — an open experience reconciles through the controller's existing load path when a queued claim lands.


## 3.0.3 — 2026-09-01

### Changed
- The dashboard's "WE HAVE A WINNER!" banner is now gated on `sdkConfig.experience.winnerBannerEnabled` and default hidden — it renders only when the server sends the flag as exactly `true` (and a `latestWinner` exists). With the banner hidden, the winner-feed modal has no entry point (intended). Keeps the GOT IT button above the fold on mobile; admin flips it on per publisher when there's a winner worth showcasing.

### Docs
- README and docs now show the current API key prefixes (`avafli_test_` / `avafli_live_`).
- README and the npm package description drop the rename-era "formerly winr-web-sdk / Formerly WINR" callouts and migration section (the 3.0.0 CHANGELOG entry keeps the migration notes).

## 3.0.2 — 2026-08-31

### Changed
- Legal pages now load from sdk.avafli.com; no winrmedia.com references remain. The in-experience privacy page is `https://sdk.avafli.com/sdk/privacy` (still opened with `?app=1`), and the delete-my-data postMessage bridge accepts only the `https://sdk.avafli.com` origin — `https://winrmedia.com` is no longer an accepted origin.

## 3.0.1 — 2026-08-28

### Fixed
- Streak display off-by-one: the dashboard staged a predicted day on top of the server's already-advanced `streakDay`, so tiles and the come-back bar could run one day ahead of the header. All three surfaces now render from server truth, and any staged/server mismatch triggers a full repaint.
- Claim results are now persisted into the cached streak state, so next-day opens no longer flash pre-claim numbers.
- The day-tile celebration burst plays only at the reveal moment (no longer replays on reopens).
- Checkbox marks now use a luminance-guarded on-accent color (legible on light publisher brand colors).

## 3.0.0 — 2026-08-25

**Full rebrand: WINR → Avafli.** New npm package name (`avafli-sdk`), new
global, new public type names. No behavioral changes to the experience, the
backend contract, or stored user state — existing users keep their streaks,
consent, and opt-out flags across the upgrade.

### Migration from 2.9.x

| 2.9.x (winr-web-sdk) | 3.0.0 (avafli-sdk) |
| --- | --- |
| `npm install winr-web-sdk` | `npm install avafli-sdk` |
| `import { WINR } from 'winr-web-sdk'` | `import { Avafli } from 'avafli-sdk'` |
| UMD global `WINR` (`WINR.configure(...)`) | UMD global `Avafli` (`Avafli.configure(...)`) |
| `dist/winr-sdk.umd.js` / `dist/winr-sdk.esm.js` / `dist/winr-sdk.d.ts` | `dist/avafli-sdk.umd.js` / `dist/avafli-sdk.esm.js` / `dist/avafli-sdk.d.ts` |
| `WINRConfiguration`, `WINROptions`, `WINRBranding`, `WINRUser` | `AvafliConfiguration`, `AvafliOptions`, `AvafliBranding`, `AvafliUser` |
| `WINRError`, `WINRErrorCode` (`error.name === 'WINRError'`) | `AvafliError`, `AvafliErrorCode` (`error.name === 'AvafliError'`) |
| `WINR_CONSTANTS` | `AVAFLI_CONSTANTS` |
| Analytics events `winr_*` (e.g. `winr_modal_presented`) | `avafli_*` (e.g. `avafli_modal_presented`) — update any dashboards keyed to the old names |
| Share links: `utm_medium=winr_share` | `utm_medium=avafli_share` |
| Debug flag `winr_debug` (URL param / localStorage, dev builds) | `avafli_debug` (legacy `winr_debug` still honored) |
| Guest ids minted as `winr_guest_…` | New guests mint `avafli_guest_…`; existing stored guest ids are kept as-is |

**Deliberately unchanged (compatibility):**

- **API keys and backend** — `winr_live_…` / `winr_test_…` keys, endpoints, and
  wire payloads are identical; no server-side change is needed to upgrade.
- **Stored state** — every persisted localStorage/sessionStorage key keeps its
  `winr_` prefix (`winr_token`, `winr_streak_state`, `winr_opted_out`, …), so
  upgrading in place loses nothing: streaks, email consent, impression caps,
  auto-open marks, and RTD opt-outs all carry over.
- **Legal pages and the delete bridge** — legal documents still load from
  `https://winrmedia.com`, and the origin-locked postMessage delete bridge now
  accepts **both** `{ type: "winr-delete" }` and `{ type: "avafli-delete" }`
  (still only from `https://winrmedia.com`), so the pages can migrate their
  message type without a lockstep SDK release.
- **DOM surface** — the shadow-DOM CSS class prefix (`.wv2-*`) and the host
  marker attribute (`data-winr="v2"`) are unchanged; any publisher CSS or
  selectors targeting them keep working.

**2.9.x is frozen.** The `winr-web-sdk` package receives no further releases;
all future development ships as `avafli-sdk`.

## 2.9.7 — 2026-08-23

- Attribution line is now "Powered by Avafli".
- Host page scroll is locked while the experience or a legal overlay is open (desktop lightbox no longer scrolls the page behind it).

## 2.9.6 — 2026-08-18

- **Desktop: restored vertical spacing on How-it-works** — the removed
  "Privacy choices" fine print had been supplying the screen's bottom
  spacing; the ≥900px lightbox now gets roomier step gaps, air around the
  warning line, and real bottom padding under the CTA (mobile drawer gets
  the matching CTA bottom padding).

## 2.9.5 — 2026-08-18

- **Legal documents open inside the experience** — Official Rules and the
  Privacy Policy now open in an in-experience overlay (slim header + iframe
  over the drawer/lightbox, works in both the mobile drawer and the desktop
  lightbox) instead of a new browser tab. Every legal entry point routes
  through it: the capture screen's inline disclaimer links, the legal links
  row (dashboard, code screen), and the how-it-works fine print. A loading
  veil covers the frame; if it never loads (some publisher CSPs block
  framing winrmedia.com — detected best-effort via timeout) the veil becomes
  an "Open in new tab" fallback.
- **"Delete my data" moved into the privacy page** — the overlay loads the
  privacy policy with `?app=1` appended (URL-API built, tolerant of existing
  query strings), which makes winrmedia.com/sdk/privacy render its delete
  section; in the framed case the page posts `{ type: "winr-delete" }` to
  the parent. The SDK's bridge accepts that message ONLY from
  `https://winrmedia.com`, only with exactly that shape, and only while the
  overlay is open (the listener detaches on close); a valid message closes
  the overlay and raises the EXISTING destructive confirmation +
  authenticated erasure flow, unchanged. The intermediate "Privacy choices"
  card (2.9) is gone. The delete confirmation now mounts at root level so
  the bridge can raise it over any screen.
- **How-it-works "Privacy choices" fine print removed** — the third privacy
  entry point was redundant once the delete path moved into the privacy
  page: the legal-links row (dashboard, code entry) and the capture screen's
  inline disclaimer links keep it findable. The link, its string, and its
  CSS are deleted.
- **Share-link UTM tagging** — when the publisher's `shareUrl` is included
  in a share action, the SDK appends `utm_source={network}&utm_medium=winr_share`
  ({network} = x | facebook | instagram | snapchat | tiktok, per the tapped
  button; Web Share API / clipboard paths keep their network's value). Built
  with the URL API so URLs with existing query strings extend correctly, and
  a shareUrl that already carries a `utm_source` param is left untouched
  (publisher tagging wins). Share-text URLs only — the Facebook host-page
  fallback (no shareUrl configured) is not tagged; nothing else changes.

## 2.9.4 — 2026-08-17

Winner-flow design round (Ryan's direction, Joe's updated Figma frames).

- **Claim review screen slimmed to its essentials** — the leftover
  "Official Rules • Privacy Policy" links row is removed from the review
  screen (it had survived 2.9.3's capture-screen dedupe). The screen now
  shows only the optional likeness checkbox, SUBMIT, and the
  secure-and-encrypted note; the capture screen's inline disclaimer links
  carry the legal surface.
- **Likeness consent names the actual publisher** — "I authorize {name} and
  its promotional partners…" where {name} is the server-fed
  `sdkConfig.appName` (new optional config field), falling back to the host
  page's `document.title` (the share line's same source), then to the
  previous generic "this app's publisher" wording.
- **Winner splash confetti** — the splash now plays a celebration layer on
  appearance (Joe's frame): the looping multicolor confetti field over the
  screen plus the one-shot Figma confetti-burst GIF over the trophy art.
  Purely decorative and non-blocking (pointer events pass through). Works in
  both the mobile drawer and the desktop lightbox. `createConfetti` now
  respects `prefers-reduced-motion` everywhere it is used: under `reduce`
  the field freezes to a single static frame, and the splash skips the GIF
  burst entirely.
- **Confirmation screen matches Joe's frame (5386:5807)** — the
  "YOUR PRIZE CLAIM HAS BEEN SUBMITTED" screen now celebrates on appearance
  with the same confetti machinery as the splash (looping field + one-shot
  burst centered on the gold keepsake card, reduced-motion aware,
  non-blocking); the "3-5 Business Days" card is a solid dark gunmetal card
  with a subtle border (envelope ring and days line already rode the
  publisher accent); and the keepsake card's OFFICIAL / WINNER labels render
  in the publisher accent instead of fixed gold. No bottom attribution
  strip.
- **"EARN." in the publisher's primary color** — the capture screen's
  VISIT. EARN. WIN. title renders "EARN." in the publisher's brand accent
  (`--wv2-accent`); VISIT. and WIN. stay white.
- **Capture checkboxes tinted with the primary color** — the 18+ and
  marketing-consent boxes: checked is an accent-filled square with a white
  check (matching the review consent box and the CTA pill), unchecked an
  accent-tinted outline.

## 2.9.3 — 2026-08-14

Note: 2.9.2 was never published to npm; 2.9.3 supersedes it.

- **Capture screen legal text deduplicated** — the disclaimer sentence and a
  separate "OFFICIAL RULES • PRIVACY POLICY" links row both appeared on the
  email capture screen. Now ONE instance: "Official Rules" and "Privacy
  Policy" inside the sentence are underlined, tappable links (same targets
  and new-tab behavior as the row), and the separate links row is removed
  from the capture screen only. Other screens that show the links row (claim
  review, how-it-works, code screen) are unchanged, and the capture screen
  keeps the reCAPTCHA attribution notice (required while the badge is
  hidden) and the Powered-by line.
- **Capture legal block bottom-anchored** — the legal block (disclaimer +
  reCAPTCHA notice + Powered-by) now sits at the bottom edge of the drawer
  instead of congested under the CTA; on short viewports (keyboard open) it
  degrades to normal scrollable flow and never overlaps the button. In the
  content-sized desktop lightbox it gets fixed comfortable spacing instead.
- **Privacy Policy links point at the real policy** — every "Privacy Policy"
  link (capture inline, legal-links row, claim review, privacy-choices
  surface) opened `rulesUrl`, a latent bug shared with the native SDKs (no
  privacy URL existed in config). They now open
  `https://winrmedia.com/sdk/privacy` (new `WINR_CONSTANTS.PRIVACY_URL`).
  "Official Rules" keeps `rulesUrl`.

## 2.9.2 — 2026-08-14

- Desktop lightbox matches the final Figma design (colored brand border,
  748px card). ≥900px only: 30px radius, 4px border in the publisher's
  primary color, 0 0 40px shadow, auto content height, and the Figma type
  ramp (49px VISIT. EARN. WIN., 27px prize strip, 35px HOW IT WORKS strip,
  36px/20px items, accent tagline, 360/343px CTA pills). Mobile/tablet
  untouched.

## 2.9.1 — 2026-08-14

- Share screen social icons updated to the official WINR brand set (Figma).

## 2.9.0 — 2026-08-14

Post-submit share step with real share actions, claim review slimmed to one
optional promo-consent checkbox, in-experience privacy-choices surface,
cross-device adoption re-entry, and a conservative desktop layout.

- **Claim review simplified** — the "information is accurate" and "agree to
  Official Rules" checkboxes are gone (rules and privacy policy remain as
  plain links). Only the likeness/promotion checkbox remains: **optional**,
  unchecked by default (affirmative-consent posture, Android parity), and it
  never gates SUBMIT. Its state is always sent as an explicit
  `promoConsentGranted` boolean.
- **Share step moved after submit** — the claim flow is now 3 steps +
  review/submit → share → confirmation. The claim is recorded before the
  share step appears, and closing it changes nothing. The story typed on the
  share step no longer rides `submitPrizeClaim`; it is attached via the new
  authed `attachClaimStory` callable (`{story}` → `{saved}`), flushed on DONE
  and on every dismissal path — fire-and-forget with one retry, at most once.
- **Real share actions** — X opens a tweet intent with a prefilled line;
  Facebook opens the sharer with the URL only (the platform disallows
  prefilled text); Instagram/Snapchat/TikTok use the Web Share API when
  available, else copy-to-clipboard with a "Copied! Paste it in your post"
  toast. The share line includes the publisher's `shareUrl` — a new optional
  `sdkConfig` field.
- **Address autocomplete (Google Places)** — when the server configures the
  new optional `sdkConfig.placesApiKey`, the claim form's Street Address
  field suggests US addresses as the winner types (debounced, keyboard-
  navigable, "powered by Google" attribution) and a selection fills
  street/city/state/zip — every field stays hand-editable. Plain `fetch`
  against the Places API (New), no Google SDK; without a key, or on any
  network/quota failure, the address step behaves exactly as plain fields.
- **Privacy choices surface** — the how-it-works ("?") screen's Privacy
  choices link now opens a small surface (privacy-policy link + delete my
  data) instead of jumping straight to the delete confirmation; the existing
  destructive confirm is unchanged and fully reachable.
- **Adoption re-entry** — a new optional `adoptionPending` on the register
  response routes the next open to the 6-digit code screen (via the new
  `restageAdoption` callable) with a "Pick up where you left off" subtitle;
  re-entry resends go through `restageAdoption`; one-shot, cleared on
  successful verification.
- **Desktop layout (≥900px)** — conservative widening to a 600px card with a
  modest type/spacing scale-up; below 900px nothing changed.
- **Flat capture background** — the email capture screen drops its radial
  accent glow and sits on the same flat gunmetal as the streak dashboard.
- **Fixed** — the claim form's zip field clipped its digits (101px box minus
  50px of padding); now flex-basis 118px with 16px padding.
- **Note** — the cross-platform "keyboard-safe forms" item is not applicable
  on web: the browser manages viewport insets and scroll-into-view for
  focused fields, so no change was needed here.

## 2.8.0 — 2026-08-13

- Self-heal for stale local capture state: when the server reports a fresh user for this device, the cached "email submitted" flag is cleared so the capture screen shows instead of a doomed auto-claim.
- A claim refused with the email-required precondition now routes to the email capture screen instead of rendering as a connection error.
- Published bundles are minified (the `prepare` script now runs the production build).
## 2.7.0 — 2026-08-11

2.7.0 — "Verify your email" soft-verification: a persistent chip on the streak
dashboard lets users confirm a newly-typed email (reusing the code screen);
never blocks daily play, only prize-draw eligibility.

## 2.6.3 — 2026-08-11

2.6.3 — firstName/lastName are now optional on WINRUser; pass only the identity
data you have and the SDK captures the rest (email via the capture screen).

## 2.6.2 — 2026-08-11

Cross-platform SDK hardening: age-gate text honors publisher config; push
notifications functional on Android/web; resend keeps the code screen; error
screens pick up publisher branding.

- **Age gate honors server config** — the capture screen's age-gate checkbox
  no longer hardcodes "18". It now renders the publisher's server-provided
  `ageGateText` when present, and otherwise builds the sentence from
  `ageGateMinAge` ("I confirm I am {minAge} years of age or older", default
  18) via a new `ageGateText` getter on the V2 controller. The value was
  already parsed from config but went unused on this screen.
- **Push notifications** — `registerForPushNotifications()` is now gated on
  `options.enablePushReminders` (previously ignored) and no longer fires a
  bare `Notification.requestPermission()` that registered no token. Functional
  web push requires a VAPID application-server key and a service worker,
  neither shipped nor exposed as config in this build, so registration is an
  honest, logged no-op ("web push not configured") until that plumbing lands —
  rather than a permission prompt that mints an undeliverable subscription.
- **Note** — resend already keeps the code screen up, the unregistered
  impression counter already increments only after the presentability check,
  the code-error taxonomy is already three-way (expired / too-many-attempts /
  incorrect), and the empty/geo/session screens already pick up the publisher
  accent via the `--wv2-accent` CSS variable; the web SDK is the reference for
  these, so no change was needed here.

## 2.6.1 — 2026-08-11

In-experience privacy opt-out (delete my data); District of Columbia added to
the prize-claim form.

- **Privacy choices** — the how-it-works ("?") screen gains a muted "Privacy
  choices" link. It raises a destructive confirmation ("Delete my data & stop
  participating"); confirming performs the RTD opt-out against `/optOut`,
  shows "Your data has been deleted.", and dismisses the experience. Unlike
  the public `WINR.optOut()` (which deliberately silences locally even when
  the network call fails), the in-experience flow is honest: failure keeps
  the confirmation up with "Something went wrong. Please check your
  connection and try again." and marks nothing until the backend confirms.
- **District of Columbia** — the prize-claim state list already carried DC;
  it is now pinned by a regression test, per the official rules' "50 states
  and the District of Columbia".
- **Fixed** — `WINR_CONSTANTS.SDK_VERSION` (sent to the backend as
  `sdkVersion`) was stuck at 2.4.0; now 2.6.1.

## 2.6.0 — 2026-08-10

User-facing error messaging per the Master Field List; honest failure states —
no fabricated claim success; fixed raw backend strings on the code screen.

- **All V2 copy centralized** in `src/ui/v2/strings.ts` (`WINRV2Strings`) —
  one surface for copy review and future localization.
- **Inline validation messages** (shown alongside the existing CTA dimming,
  which alone explained nothing): invalid email on the capture screen; first
  name / last name / optional 10-digit phone on the winner claim form.
- **Dedicated failure states**: geo-blocked ("Not available in your
  location") and session-expired (with RETRY) instead of the generic
  "Nothing to see here yet".
- **Honest claim failures**: a failed auto-claim shows the dashboard
  UNCLAIMED with a retryable notice; a cross-device "already entered today"
  rejection shows a transient explanatory notice.
- **Code screen fixes**: backend error text is never rendered raw (fixed
  strings for expired / too-many-attempts / mismatch); a failed resend stays
  on the code screen with an inline error.
- **Email submit failures are no longer swallowed**: the capture screen stays
  up with an inline error and the user can retry.

## 2.5.1 — 2026-08-10

Consent correctness and cross-device security.

- **Marketing consent checkbox starts UNCHECKED** — consent is an affirmative
  act (pre-ticked boxes are invalid under GDPR and disfavored by US state
  regulators). Declining still blocks nothing.
- **Email pre-fill**: pass your signed-in user's email via `WINRUser.email` and
  the capture screen shows it read-only — the address the user consents for is
  always one they proved to you. Malformed values fall back to the editable
  field.
- **Guest sessions**: no account system, or the user is signed out? Use the
  guest sentinel (or omit the user on web). The SDK mints a stable per-install
  `winr_guest_…` id for attribution; re-configure with the real user later and
  the streak carries over.
- **Verified adoption**: typing an email that already belongs to an existing
  WINR account now requires a 6-digit code sent to that inbox before the
  streak transfers to the new device. Fresh signups and pre-filled partner
  emails never see it.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-08-06

### Breaking

`WINR.deleteUserData()` is **removed**. Use `WINR.optOut()`. The old call
hard-deleted entry records — the evidence a drawing was fair — left no
tombstone, and never cleaned prize-claim PII. `optOut()` is identity-wide and
complete.

### Added

Browser perimeter defence. The SDK now attaches a risk-scored reCAPTCHA
Enterprise token to device registration, closing the gap where a browser has no
hardware anchor and a script can drive signup freely.

It is **score-based**: no challenge, no puzzle, nothing the user interacts with.
The floating reCAPTCHA badge is suppressed and the required attribution appears
instead as one line in the existing legal footer.

It **never blocks the experience**. A publisher Content-Security-Policy that
forbids Google, an offline first load or a slow network all degrade to sending
no token, and registration proceeds; the backend decides what to do about that.
Enforcement is off by default while the score distribution is measured.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-08-05

Consent capture on the email screen, matching the iOS, Android and Flutter
SDKs.

### Added
- **Marketing-consent checkbox on the capture screen.** A second checkbox sits
  directly below the 18+ age gate, PRE-CHECKED, covering ONE thing: the
  publisher using the address for MARKETING email. It reads "I agree to
  receive marketing emails from this app" by default; in practice the backend
  supplies a publisher-named string via
  `sdkConfig.copy.emailCapture.emailConsentText` (or the flat legacy
  `sdkConfig.copy.emailConsentText`), and the SDK renders it verbatim — it
  never interpolates a publisher name itself. The row is built by the same
  code path as the age row, so the two are identical.
  **Declining it costs the user nothing:** the CTA is still enabled on (age
  confirmed AND valid email) alone, the entry is claimed as normal, and
  winner contact is unaffected — if this person is drawn, they are contacted
  either way. No checkbox gates that.

### Changed
- **Age confirmation is now transmitted and stored server-side.** `submitEmail`
  sends `{ email, ageConfirmed, marketingConsent }` carrying the real state of
  both checkboxes — the age gate's value used to be discarded on the client.
  `ageConfirmed` is always sent; the backend keys off it to detect a 2.4.0+
  client.

### Tests
- 5 new: the age gate renders unchecked and marketing consent renders
  pre-checked directly below it with identical styling, the copy override
  precedence (nested → flat → default), the CTA gating being untouched by the
  consent box (including unchecking it after enabling the CTA), and the
  submitted payload carrying the real `ageConfirmed`/`marketingConsent` values
  in both directions with no stray keys.

## [2.3.3] - 2026-08-05

Load-experience defects found testing the SDK inside a real publisher app
(ported from the Flutter SDK's 2.3.3).

### Fixed
- **The drawer no longer sits on a loading state for seconds.** It auto-opens
  ahead of its sequential network calls (registerDevice → getActiveGiveaway →
  claim). When the browser already has a cached giveaway AND a persisted
  streak, the real dashboard now paints IMMEDIATELY from that cache and the
  fresh response reconciles in place — reusing the same no-replay guards the
  celebration staging already used, so the celebration still fires exactly
  once (the come-back bar now accepts a late-arriving toast rather than
  missing it, and a one-shot marker keeps it from playing twice). The
  email-capture gate is unchanged: an unconsented user NEVER sees a cached
  dashboard. A cache-rendered dashboard also survives a subsequent network
  failure instead of collapsing to the empty state.
- **Cold start shows a skeleton, not a spinner.** With nothing cached to paint,
  the loading view is now a pulsing block-out of the real layout (grab handle,
  header, prize card, three streak tiles, come-back bar, CTA pill) in the
  drawer's own gunmetal instead of a centered spinner and "Loading…". One
  shared pulse keeps every block in phase, and `prefers-reduced-motion` stills
  it.
- **The prize image arrives with the card instead of popping in after it.**
  The publisher's `prizeImageUrl` (and `branding.logoUrl`) are now pulled into
  the browser's image cache as soon as the SDK learns the giveaway config — at
  registration, on every giveaway refresh, and once more when the experience
  mounts — so the card normally paints its art on its first frame. Already
  warmed URLs are no-ops; a failed one is dropped so the next refresh retries;
  non-DOM/SSR hosts are a safe no-op. A cold URL fades in over ~200ms against
  the card's deep charcoal rather than flashing, and a broken one falls back
  to the bundled cash hero.
- **Email consent is cached on submit.** A successful email submit now sets the
  SDK's cached `emailConsentStatus` immediately instead of waiting for the next
  `getActiveGiveaway`, so the auto-open engine's unregistered-impression cap
  can't read stale consent regardless of check ordering.

### Tests
- 22 new: cache-first render (painted without waiting on the network, calm
  frame with no celebration artifacts, cold cache → skeleton, unconsented user
  → email capture, no stomping of fresher truth, offline survival), the
  late-arriving come-back toast firing exactly once, and image prewarming
  (warm once, no-op on repeat, retry after failure, `decode()`-less fallback,
  safe when `Image` is undefined) plus the hero's fade/warm/fallback paths.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-08-04

- **Winner prize-claim flow (Joe's stepped design)** — when the backend marks
  the user as the drawn winner (`prizeClaim.status == "pending"` on
  `getActiveGiveaway`), the experience opens on the winner splash instead of
  the dashboard: CONGRATULATIONS! + prize strip → a 4-step form with a
  persistent header, "STEP N OF 4" label, and four connected accent progress
  dots (steps slide horizontally; back chevron from step 2 on):
  1. TELL US ABOUT YOURSELF — first/last name, the locked masked winning
     email (`prizeClaim.maskedEmail`, generic copy fallback), optional phone;
  2. WHERE SHOULD WE SEND YOUR PRIZE? — street/apt/city, 50-state + DC
     picker + 5-digit zip, Country locked US;
  3. SHOW OFF YOUR WIN! — optional photo via a circular preview with camera
     badge, UPLOAD PHOTO / TAKE PHOTO (camera capture on devices that have
     one), client-side downscale to ≤1200px JPEG ≤5MB;
  4. PLEASE SHARE A LITTLE — optional story (sent as `story`, trimmed) and a
     Share-on-Social-Media glyph row (native share sheet where available);
  then the ALMOST DONE! review screen — three required consent checkboxes
  (accuracy, likeness release, Official Rules/Privacy Policy), SUBMIT PRIZE
  CLAIM, and the secure-and-encrypted lock note — → `submitPrizeClaim` →
  confirmation with the gold OFFICIAL WINNER card and RETURN TO APP.
  Appears automatically — no integration work — and takes precedence over the
  email gate; a pending claim even outlives its giveaway. The daily
  auto-claim still fires silently while the flow is up. An already-submitted
  claim shows the normal dashboard, and a stale "Not the winner"/"Already
  submitted" rejection falls back to the dashboard silently instead of
  trapping the user in the form.
- **First-frame celebration beat** — on a claim-day open the dashboard mounts
  with a PREDICTED grant already staged from the pre-claim status (ladder math
  mirrors the backend), so the celebration is the first visible frame; the
  real claim runs in the background and reconciles totals/streak silently in
  place (no second celebration; "Already claimed" re-syncs once and other
  failures settle back to server truth quietly). The 2.2.0 "CLAIM {n}
  ENTRIES" click is gone — nothing to press, the pill reads GOT IT
  throughout, and only the Day-1 "You're in!" welcome modal remains.
- **Toast-first come-back bar, new copy** — on celebration opens the bar's
  first visible state is the "YOU'RE ON A ROLL! / Your {N} entries have been
  added automatically." toast; it holds ~2.5s, then slides once to the
  resting come-back pitch. Non-celebration opens rest on the pitch.
- **Reveal-beat tile: confetti-burst explosion + restored check/confetti** —
  the active day tile keeps the drawn draw-on check, falling-confetti field,
  and pulsing glow, now topped by a one-shot confetti-burst GIF explosion
  that overflows the tile (the big-check tile-burst GIF was rejected and
  removed). The burst fires only on the reveal, never on a same-day reopen.
- **Count-up total with burst** — Total Entries counts up (ease-out) and pops
  a confetti burst as it lands.
- **Prize card — the Delta A/B visuals** — dark and full-bleed: the prize
  image fills the whole card, the streak/total-entries stats sit in a solid
  black strip inside the top edge, and the headline overlays the bottom over
  a black→transparent scrim, in two layouts (A: right-aligned "WIN $1,000 /
  CASH PRIZE" for cash; B: centered "Win a {Prize}" + accent value line
  otherwise).

## [2.2.0] - 2026-08-04

- **Day 2+ reveal flow** (parity with iOS `e7fae27`) — the auto-claim still
  fires silently the moment the experience opens, but for returning users
  (streak day 2+) there is no celebration modal anymore. The dashboard opens
  pinned to YESTERDAY's numbers — streak label N-1, pre-claim total, today's
  tile in a new `ready` state (accent glow + white flame, no checkmark, no
  confetti) — behind a "CLAIM {n} ENTRIES" pill. Clicking it is the reveal:
  the tile checks off with confetti, the streak label advances, the total
  counts up to the post-claim value, and the pill becomes "GOT IT" (which
  closes the experience). The come-back bar shows the next day's entries in
  both states.
- **Day 1** keeps the "You're in!" celebration modal as its reveal (email
  capture → claim → modal); its GOT IT now closes the whole experience.
- **Copy** — email-capture CTA renamed "GET MY {n} ENTRIES" →
  "CLAIM MY {n} ENTRIES".
- **Fixed: auto-open never firing when `configure()` runs before the DOM is
  ready** (e.g. the SDK snippet in `<head>`). The shadow-DOM host was appended
  to `document.body` before it existed, the resulting error was swallowed, and
  — because the once-per-day mark and the unregistered-impression count were
  written *before* presentation — every same-day re-check short-circuited and
  the SDK stayed silent (after 3 such days, permanently for unregistered
  users). The auto-open check now defers until DOMContentLoaded when `<body>`
  isn't available yet, rolls the once-per-day mark and impression count back
  if a presentation fails to mount, and releases the internal
  "already on screen" guard on a failed mount.

- **Removed (BREAKING)** — manual `WINR.present()` and `WINR.presentInline()`
  (and the `PresentationOptions` export): the experience is exclusively
  auto-opened by the SDK, at most once per calendar day (server kill switch,
  unregistered impression cap, and RTD opt-out respected). Integration is
  `WINR.configure()` only.
- README corrections (auto-open-only integration; demo replay reworked to
  clear the once-per-day mark and re-run the auto-open engine)

## 2.0.0 (2026-08-03)

- **V2 experience** — full port of the iOS V2 design (Joe's Figma): gunmetal drawer,
  bundled Inter/Oswald fonts, prize card with default cash hero, horizontally
  scrolling streak rail with accelerator milestone tiles, come-back bar,
  celebration modal with animated checkmark + looping confetti, how-it-works,
  and the "WE HAVE A WINNER!" banner + gold winner dialog
- **Responsive presentation** — bottom drawer (iOS-style, 90% height, 30px top
  radius) below 768px; the same content as a centered modal card (~440px,
  24px radius, scale/fade) at 768px and up
- **Auto-open engine** — the experience opens automatically on the first visit
  of each calendar day (server kill switch `sdkConfig.experience.autoOpenEnabled`;
  unregistered users capped at `experience.unregisteredImpressionCap` auto-opens,
  default 3; RTD opted-out users never see it)
- **Auto-claim** — entries are granted automatically when the experience opens;
  celebration on success, silent claimed-state + one-shot re-sync on
  "Already claimed" (another device claimed first)
- **API models** — `Giveaway.prizeImageUrl`, `Giveaway.streakMode`
  ("daily" | "visit"), `Giveaway.latestWinner`, `SDKConfig.experience`
- **Shadow DOM everywhere** — the whole experience renders inside a shadow root;
  fonts/imagery ship embedded in the bundle (no CDN fetches)
- **Removed** — rewarded-video/bonus flow and the `rewardedVideoProvider`
  option; Lottie/server-media rendering (V2 hardcodes the design; branding is
  logo + primaryColor + prizeImageUrl only)
